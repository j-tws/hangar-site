# **HANGAR - A place to handle all your eatery bookings in one go**

PROJECT IDEA - A platform where individuals can handle all bookings in one place! Whether be cafe, restaurants, or hanging out at the pub, the app will have an in-built calendar to keep track of all your made bookings. Apart from that there is also a enquiry & support feature where you can send any queries or requests to the admin support and they will respond to you in your enquiry section. To add more fun, there is also a couple of admin accounts which are made to enhance interactivity with "normal" user accounts, and also the ability to control various aspect of the site. 

## **Project Background**

This is a project that emphasize on the back-end of web development, which involves understanding CRUD, databases, web servers and routing. As part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive curriculum, we had two weeks of learning Ruby and Rails fundamentals. After that we have a week to build a live project using Ruby and Rails, which will be deployed on Heroku and it is able to be viewed publicly. After all the best way to put our knowledge gained to good use is to build a functional product!

## **Project Walkthrough**

HANGAR's theme revolve around bookings - people can sign up an account and make bookings at various listed eateries. Eateries are further classified into either restaurant, bar, or cafe.
